üß† Overview
Pollen identification plays a crucial role in climate studies, allergy research, and forensic science. Manual classification is time-consuming and error-prone. This project introduces an automated system using image preprocessing and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classifying pollen grain images.

‚ú® Features
üì∑ Image preprocessing (denoising, normalization, segmentation)

üß™ Feature extraction using CNN

üß† Classification using deep learning (ResNet, VGG, or custom CNN)

üìä Accuracy and performance metrics

üñºÔ∏è Visualization of predictions and confusion matrix

üìÇ Dataset
We used the Pollen Grains Dataset containing [X] classes of pollen types, with [N] high-resolution microscopic images in total.

Classes:
Pollen Type 1

Pollen Type 2

...

Pollen Type N

Note: You can also use your own dataset. Make sure images are labeled correctly in subdirectories.

üß∞ Model Architecture
Input Layer: 224x224 RGB images

Convolutional Layers: 3-5 layers with ReLU and MaxPooling

Dense Layers: Fully connected layers with dropout

Output Layer: Softmax activation with N classes

Optionally, you can use pretrained models like:

ResNet50

VGG16

MobileNetV2
